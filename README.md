I want to say something personally since Koil for some reason thinks we sold these files we have never sold them and the Server is made from you can check each Server side it wont be the same as NoPixel maybe a function or two but most of this was made from scratch as project by me and who is credited to recreate NoPixel not using ESX like the rest of fivem. 
I have no hate towards NoPixel its the best server there is and by far has the best Dev Team this was a personal project with group of friends not something malicous.
Im Hoping people dont just download and Re-Sell this as kinda scummy its free for a reason.
